      "\t* Encourage the patient to adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.\n",

      "\t* Encourage the patient to take their medication as prescribed and monitor their blood pressure regularly.\n",
      "\t* Suggest lifestyle changes to help lower blood pressure, such as reducing sodium intake, increasing potassium-rich foods, and staying hydrated.\n",
      "3. **Headache Management:**\n",
      "\t* Recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, for occasional headaches.\n",
      "\t* Advise the patient to keep a headache diary to track patterns and potential triggers.\n",

      "**Secondary Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Fatigue Management:**\n",
      "\t* Encourage the patient to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night.\n",
      "\t* Recommend taking short breaks during the day to stretch and rest.\n",
      "2. **Monitoring and Follow-up:**\n",
      "\t* Schedule a follow-up appointment with the patient in 6 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Primary Care Physician Referral:** Consider referring the patient to a primary care physician for further evaluation and management of their chronic conditions.\n",
      "2. **Referral to Specialist:** If the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, consider referring them to a specialist, such as a neurologist or cardiologist, for further evaluation and treatment.\n",

      "**Pattern Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the patient's symptoms, I have identified several potential patterns:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Hypertension:** The patient's high blood pressure may be contributing to their fatigue and headaches.\n",
      "2. **Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS):** The patient's persistent fatigue could be indicative of CFS, a condition characterized by persistent fatigue that is not relieved by rest.\n",
